### Pull-to-Open Cart Modal

The user drags down the UI's Cart Tab to reveal/hide the Cart modal. This is implemented with the use of GSAP's draggable interaction and elastic animation.

Every time an item is added to the screen, the Cart Tab animates, providing a visual hint as to what the user must do to open the Cart modal.

Last, the Cart icon changes if the cart is empty or not.
